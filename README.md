Used Algorithm: Linear Search

Used Libraries 
OS: I used this library to access the files stored on my computer.
Pandas: I used the Pandas library to facilitate the processes of reading, writing, and searching inside of the CSV file.

Definition of The Problem
Windows 10's file searching capability is often considered weak. When searching for a file in Windows 10, the system often suggests searching the web and fails to locate the file.

Solution and Explanation of The Code
We have a file named 'file_locations.csv', which contains the names and locations of previously searched and found files. In the first step of my program, it checks the file for the names and locations. If there is no match in the CSV file, the program will perform a linear search through the computer to find the file. If the program finds the file, it will save the name and location of the file in the CSV file. The goal of using the CSV file is to make the file searching process more efficient for files that have been searched and found before.
